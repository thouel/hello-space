## Bugs

- in modal, make the cross visible in light and dark theme

- When opening a modal, we scroll to the bottom of the page and start loading immediately (because the {modal} is inserted after {children} in root layout). Perhaps we can use a lib to block body scroll such as [body-scroll-lock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-scroll-lock) => mitigated by putting {modal} on top of {children} in root layout
